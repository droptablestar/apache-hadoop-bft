Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks.
She  went for a walk in the forest.
Pretty soon, she came upon a house.
She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.
At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge.
Goldilocks was hungry.
She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.
This porridge is too hot! she exclaimed.
So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.
This porridge is too cold, she said
So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.
Ahhh, this porridge is just right, she said happily and she ate it all up.
After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts she decided she was feeling a little tired.  So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs.
Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest her feet.  
This chair is too big! she exclaimed.
